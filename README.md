# Regression-Analysis-and-Twitter-DataSet
## ECE 219 - Project 4


In this project we explore regression analysis which is a powerful statistical method that allows us to examine the relationship between two or more variables of interest. We use regression analysis to assess the strength of the relationship between variables and for modeling the future relationship between them.

Regression analysis includes several variations, such as linear, multiple linear, and nonlinear. The most common models are simple linear and multiple linear. Nonlinear regression analysis is commonly used for more complicated data sets in which the dependent and independent variables show a nonlinear relationship.

In the first part of this project, we explore with two datasets provided to us: 
- Diamond Characteristics Data Set
- Gas Turbine CO and NOx Emission Data Set

In the second part of the project we define our own task and work with twitter data set to build an end-to-end ML pipeline to achieve the goal of our chosen task.

The three files are as follows:
- gas_emissions.ipynb : Includes all questions for gas emissions dataset
- Project4_Diamonds.ipynb : Includes all questions for diamonds dataset
- Project4.ipynb : Consists parts of data analysis for diamonds dataset
- Q2-3.ipynb : Includes Question 2 and 3 analysis for both datasets
- Twitter_Data.ipynb : Includes Twitter Dataset.
